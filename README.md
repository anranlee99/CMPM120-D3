### Requirements
- The game uses a drag and release input to play the game. There is also a buttons for single general functionality
- Since the player can only manipulate the ball, they cannot beat the levels without using the intended mechanic
- The game has the "Intro", "Zones", and "Pegs" levels
- I considered creating menu/intro/outro scenes, but ended up just going with an outro scene since I made a main menu but it felt pointless.
